<h2>Inspiration</h2>
As a college student, we find ourselves constantly sharing meals and having to deal with the struggle of splitting our bills afterwards. Bulletbill is our fast solution to automate the bill splitting process.
<h2>What is bulletbill?</h2>
Bulletbill is a webapp that allows you to upload an image of your receipt and use OCR and AI to recognize text on receipts. The individual items are separated, and the user can assign which people purchased which items. Finally, the user can input people's phone numbers and their own venmo to send a personalized text about how much they are owed.
<h2>What was it built with?</h2>
